|_. What |_. local cloud |_. Azure |
|To uninstall a service | uninstall-service yourSerivceName | Not Available |
|To uninstall an application | uninstall-application yourAppName | uninstall-application yourAppName&#43; |
|Kill all deployed processes and VMs | teardown-localcloud | azure:teardown-app hosted_service_name |


 &#43;*Note:*
# When you invoke *uninstall-application yourAppName* In Azure, it leaves the VMs alive and only kills the deployed services.
# Invoking *install-application yourAppName* In Azure, after invoking *uninstall-application yourAppName* , will be faster since there will be no need to re-create VMs.

h2(#q). *Q: I deployed a Tomcat service and now I have a new WAR file. Do I need to re-install the whole application?*

 *A:* You don't need to re-install an application in order to update a WAR file.
In order to do that, when you install an application, you must add an "updateWar" custom command (in your recipe's custom commands section) to your recipe.
You can read more about custom commands "here":/guide/developing/custom_commands

h2(#q). *Q: Is Cloudify open source?*

 *A:* Yes indeed.
 <br/>
 "We":http://www.gigaSpaces.com have also contributed to the "JClouds":http://www.jclouds.org/ open source project around its OpenStack compute and BLOB store support, and we plan to contribute more in the future, because we believe that cloud portability is key to reducing entry barriers and making cloud less intimidating. 

 You can "Fork us on GitHub":https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify

h2(#q). *Q: What application stacks can I use?*

 *A:* Cloudify enables you to on-board any Application onto any Cloud.
 	We wanted to provide a flexible yet simple mechanism to deploy and manage applications on the cloud. But we also wanted it to be flexible enough to support any kind of application. In other words, we decided that our platform would support your application no matter what application stack you use (Java/Spring, Java EE, PHP, .NET, Ruby on Rails or others), whether you are using a relational (such as MySQL) or non-relational (e.g., Apache Cassandra) data store, or if you choose to add other middleware components. Regardless of your application set-up, you can still use Cloudify to... Cloudify it.

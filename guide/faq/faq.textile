h4(#q2). *Can I remove a service after I deploy an application?*

Yes....

h4(#q3). *Can I add a service after I deploy an application?*

Yes....

h4(#q4). *I deployed a tomcat service and now I have a new WAR file. Do I need to re-install the whole application?*

You don't need to re-install an application in order to update a WAR file.
In order to do that, when you install an application, you must add an "updateWar" custom command to your recipe.
You can read more about custom commands "here":/guide/developing/custom_commands .

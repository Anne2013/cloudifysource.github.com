h2. The Recipes Tab

Cloudify comes with a hidden repository feature. 
If you switch the feature ON, by default we clone the Cloudify recipes repository and then allow you to browse through it, modify the files and install services/applications. 

h4(info). Despite the fact that it's called "Cloudify repository" and despite the fact that this feature uses "GIT" behind the scenes, it is by no means a fully qualified SVC in the current version. Cloudify does NOT use "commit" nor "push" code. It simply clones the content of the repository. 
Updating the content of a file simply translates into writing the content of that specific file. 
Cloudify has a basic support to collisions (prevents you from saving a file after someone else has changed it while you were editing).

Here's a screenshot that shows the recipes tab:

h2. Configuration

The webui has a spring context XML file called "cloudify-webui-context.xml" : 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tamirko/5230978.js"></script>

You can define your own file which overrides the cloudify-webui-context.xml.
For localcloud you place it under "config" (XXX) and for remote clouds you will place it under an override folder (XXX). 
The overriding file should be named "cloudify-webui-context-override.xml".

# Modifying the value for "recipesRepository" to true will turn the feature on. 
# Modifying the "URI" on repositoryDefinitionBean - will modify the location from which is cloned by Cloudify.
# Modifying the "rootFolder" on repositoryDefinitionBean - will modify the target folder to which is cloned by Cloudify. 
# Modifying "existingMethod" will modify how Cloudify handles an existing clone. USE will simply use the folder, USE_IF_VALID will validate this is a proper clone - if not, Cloudify will delete the folder and clone again. 

Here's an override example:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tamirko/5230984.js"></script>

This configuration also allows you to modify the implementation of the interface. 
The interface is available as a MAVEN dependency with the following details :
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tamirko/5230970.js"></script>

h2. Using the Recipes Tab

The recipes tab enables you to modify a recipe and then install it.

h1. The Service Context API

The Service Context API provides means to access other Application Services or other Service Nodes from within a lifecycle script.


h1. Gaining access to the Service Context API

The ServiceContext API is accessed using the __ServiceContextFactory__:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1700385.js?file=getServiceContext.groovy"></script>


Now, you can access any Application service by name, using the __waitForService__ Method:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1700450.js?file=wait4Cassandra.groovy"></script>

The __current__ service - the service in which the above code would be running - can be accessed using __context.serviceName__.

h1. The Service Methods

The __Service__ object has the following methods:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1700479.js?file=serviceMethods.groovy"></script>

h1. The Service Instance Methods

The __ServiceInstance__ object can be referenced from the __Service__ object using __getInstances()__.

To find out the current instance Id, use __context.getInstanceId()__.

The _ServiceInstance__ object provides the following methods:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1703676.js?file=serviceInstanceMethods.groovy"></script>

h1. Writing and Reading Runtime Attributes

Cloudify enables the user to exchange information between different contexts such as Application, Service and Service Instance, using the Attributes API.

The Attributes API is identical to the Groovy HashMap API.
Obtaining access to the attributes of an application, service or service instance is done through the Service Context API:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1703679.js?file=accessAttributes.groovy"></script>

The next sections demonstrate how to use this Attributes API in various use cases.

h3. Writing and Reading Service and Application Attributes:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1703703.js?file=readWriteAttr1.groovy"></script>

h3. Writing and Reading Service Instance Attributes

The Attributes API enables you to retrieve values of attributes from other service instances in the same cluster(service) or from other services in the same application:

p. How to use the Cloudify Management Console to troubleshoot your Deployment

h1. Deployment Verification
Cloudify provides several means for deployment verification:
* The Application Map - The application map depicts the deployment blueprint, the current status and the actual number of instances deployed. As soon as Virtual Machines were provisioned and Cloudify agents were inastalled on them, the Management
console will display the application map. At that point the user can verify that the recipe was received correctly by Cloudify and follow the deployment progress.

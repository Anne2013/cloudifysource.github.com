This topic provides instructions for configuring Windows Azure for Cloudify.

h1. Prerequisites

* Windows machine (running Windows 7 , Windows Server 2008, or Windows Vista SP1)
Make sure you have the latest Windows service packs, as some of them are prerequisites for the Windows Azure SDK

* Windows Azure account (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/free-trial/">Windows Azure</a> )
* Silverlight-enabled web browser (required for Azure Online Management Console) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/">Download Silverlight</a>
* Java Development Kit 1.6(<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java JDK</a>)

h1. Azure Terminology


*Role Instance*
A Role Instance is a Virtual Machine running one or more processes that serve a specific purpose.

*Role* 
A Role consists of one or more Role Instances, and includes configuration that specifies the virtual machine size, the internal firewall ports, and the load balancer port forwarding. The number of instances per role can be changed dynamically.

*Deployment*
A deployment consists of one or more Roles, and a single round-robin load balancer with a unique URL prefix. Production deployments have a unique URL prefix (such as: myJavaservice.cloudapp.net). Staging deployments have a random URL prefix.

*Hosted Service*
Azure Hosted Services consists of one or two deployments (staging and/or production). The staging and production deployments can swap their IP addresses.

*Subscription*
Subscription is associated with your Windows Live account, and can run zero or more Hosted Services

h1. Azure Security Credentials


Understanding Azure security credentials is necessary to successfully manage a Java application running on Azure.

*Windows Live Credentials*
Credentials are the username and password used to log into the  (<a href="http://windows.azure.com/">Azure Management Portal</a> ). Because Windows Live does not support two-factor authentication, make sure you use a strong password.

*Remote Desktop Personal inFormation eXchange (RDP PFX) Cerificate*
The RDP PFX certificate contains both a private and public key, and is attached to an Azure deployment. After the PFX certificate is generated on your local machine, you must upload it to a specific deployment. The PFX file is password protected, and this password is not the windows password and is only required when uploading the certificate to Azure. The certificate itself inside the PFX file is used to encrypt and decrypt the windows passwords. Do not confuse the password that protects the PFX file, with the windows password that is later encrypted by the certificates inside the PFX file.

PFX files contain the private and the public key, CERT files contain the public key

*Management API (REST) X509 Certificates*
Management certificates are used to authenticate the REST API client (for example, during a scaling-out command). The public key (cert file) is uploaded to the Azure "Management Certificates" section. The private key is installed on the client's local certificate store:

h1. Configuring Windows Azure

This section provides step-by-step instructions for the following tasks:
# "Installing the Cloudify shell":#installCloudifyShell
# "Updating *subscriptionId* in azure.properties":#updateSubscriptionId
# "Creating Remote Desktop certificates":#createRDCertificate
# "Creating the Management certificate":#createManagementCertificate
# "Uploading the Management certificate":#uploadManagementCertificate
# "Updating the Blob Storage details":#updateBlobStorage

h3(#installCloudifyShell). Installing the Cloudify shell

For information about installing the Cloudify shell, see "Installing the Cloudify Shell":/guide/setup/installing_the_cloudify_client

h3(#updateSubscriptionId). Updating *subscriptionId* in azure.properties

# Login to your "Azure Management Portal":http://windows.azure.com
  If the *Isolated Storage Quota* dialog box opens, click *Change Quota* to allow Windows Azure's Silverlight application to use your local disk for temporary storage.
# From the bottom-left menu, select "Hosted Services"
<img src="../images/azure/config1.png"/>
# From the top-left menu, select "Hosted Services"
<img src="../images/azure/config2.png"/>
# Select the Subscription row
<img src="../images/azure/config3.png"/>
# Copy the subscription id (bottom right)
<img src="../images/azure/config3b.png"/>
# Paste it into  c:\cloudify\tools\cli\plugins\azure\azure.properties as the value of "subscriptionId"

h3(#createRDCertificate). Create Remote Desktop Certificates 
 
In this tutorial we will use the password 123456 in order to encrypt pfx files.
# Create an Azure management (private and public) certificate protected with the password 123456. This password is not the Windows password; it is only used for encrypting the PFX file that holds the private key.
Open a command prompt window (Start-> cmd.exe)
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1760185.js?file=certificate%20creation"></script>
# Choose a Windows password and encrypt it. This is not your windows azure password. This is the Windows Operating System password used for logging into the virtual machines (role instances) via Remote Desktop. Choose a password with at least 10 characters, containing capital letters, lower case letters and numbers.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1760193.js?file=API_certificate"></script>
Copy the encrypted password and paste it into <Cloudify Home>\tools\cli\plugins\azure\azure.properties file as the value of "rdpLoginEncryptedPassword"
Change the value of "rdpLoginUsername" to "Administrator". This would be your Windows Operating System user name that is used to log in with Remote Desktop.

h3(createManagementCertificate). Create Management (API) Certificates

This step is only required if you wish to change the number of role instances from the interactive shell (scale out)
# Create the management API certificate:
 *encutil -create -alias azure_api -pwd 123456 -pfx azure_api.pfx -cert azure_api.cer*
# Save the certificate thumbprint, for later use.
 *encutil -thumbprint -cert azure_api.cer*

# Copy the thumbprint and paste it into c:\cloudify\tools\cli\plugins\azure\azure.properties as the value of "certificateThumbprint"(required for scaling out)
# Install the management certificate on the local management store.
Open MMC (Start-> mmc)
File -> Add Snapins 
Select "Certificates" and click Add
Choose "Computer Account" and click Next and Finish.
Expand the Certificates tree and right click Personal
Choose All Tasks &rarr; Import
Browse to the azure_api.pfx file (Make sure that when you browse for the file, the dialog box filter is PFX and not CER)
Click next and enter the file password (123456)
Check the "Mark this key exportable"  (Click Next then Finish)
# Delete the PFX file from your hard drive (it is in the cert store and can be exported when working from a different computer)

h3(#uploadManagementCertificate). Upload Management Certificate

Log in with your Windows Live credentials to the Azure Management Portal <a href="http://windows.azure.com">Azure Management Portal</a> 

# From the bottom-left menu select "Hosted Services"
<img src="../images/azure/config7.png"/>
# From the top-left menu select "Management Certificates"
<img src="../images/azure/config8.png"/>
# Click the "Add Certificate" icon
(top left)
<img src="../images/azure/config9.png"/>
# Browse to azure_api.cer file
<img src="../images/azure/config10.png"/>

h3(#updateBlobStorage). Update the Blob Storage details

# From the bottom-left menu select "Hosted Services"
<img src="../images/azure/config7.png"/>
# From the top-left menu select "Storage Accounts"
# If you don't have one already, create a new Storage Account.
# Copy the storage account name and paste it to c:\cloudify\tools\cli\plugins\azure\azure.properties sotrageAccount value.
# Click the "View Access Key" button and copy the Primary Access Key to the azure.properties storageAccessKey value

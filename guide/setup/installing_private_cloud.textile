p. How to Install Cloudify on a Private Cloud

h1. Store Cloudify Binaries on the Cloud

As private Clouds often don't allow for interent outbound calls, or just in order to speed up Cloudify, you need to store Cloudify binaries 
on a local storage.

Cloudify Cloud Driver will use the stored binaries when bootstrapping Cloudify management and when installing the Cloudify agents
on the applications virtual hosts. Some Private Clouds might have a storage service so you can use this service to install the binaries
and get a URI you can use with the cloud driver configuration. In Citrix Cloudstack case, you will need to create a VM 
on which you will store the Cloudify Binaries.

h1. Create The Images You Need

this step is optional as you can use images you already have with Cloudify. However, if your applications requires additional
images, you can create them via the private cloud console. In this example on Citrix Cloudstack

h1. Configure the Cloud Driver

the last step is about configuring the Cloud Driver. This involves mainly 2 things:
* Credentials for using the Cloud API
* The templates with the images your application would like to consume

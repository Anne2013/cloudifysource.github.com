h2. BYON Overview

The BYON Cloud Driver is an impelementation of the Cloudify Cloud Driver allowing a user to use a set of physical machines or virtual machines
as one or more pools for application virtualizations.
Typical use case for such a scenario can be development and QA Labs.

The BYON works very similar to other Cloud Drivers. It defines templates that have aliases that can be referenced by the different
recipes. Each template is a pool of machines that can be defined by specifying each IP, IP range or even a CIDR mask

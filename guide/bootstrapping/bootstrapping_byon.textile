h1. Bootstrapping The Bring You Own Node (BYON) Host Pool

h2. BYON Overview

The BYON Cloud Driver is an implementation of the Cloudify Cloud Driver allowing a user to use a set of physical 
machines or virtual machines
as one or more pools for application virtualizations.
Typical use case for such a scenario can be development and QA Labs.

The BYON works very similar to other Cloud Drivers. It defines templates that have aliases that can be referenced 
by the different recipes. 
Each template is a pool of machines that can be defined by specifying each IP, IP range or even a CIDR mask.

When the BYON driver is asked to bootstrap the pool it simply access one machine in the template specified for the 
management machine and using SSH it installs the Cloudify management components on it.

When the BYON driver is requested by Cloudify controller to provision machines for application installation, 
it will install and start Cloudify agent on available machine using the templates names specified in the service recipes.

In that sense you can allocate different HW and SW stack to different services, exactly the same way as running a recipe 
on a cloud

h2. BYON Prerequisites 

Please note that Cloudify expects Java JDK and SSH to be installed on the machines in the pools. 
Please check the "Prerequisites page":/guide/bootstrapping/bootstrapping_byon for more information.

h2. Configuring the BYON Driver

The BYON configuration is quite simple. The configuration file byon.groovy is located 
under <Cloudify>/tools/cli/plugins/esc/byon

In this file you need to modify the following attributes:

In the configuration block: 
* set the SSH username (remoteUsername)
* set the SSH password (remotePassword)
* set the management machine template (managementMachineTemplate) to the template name you want to use for 
the management machine 

Next, you need to create template(s) for your machine pools. As you can see there is an example template 
names "SMALL_LINUX_32" 
You can use this example for additional pools changing the template name.
In each template you need to configure the following:
* node id (id) - this is an alias for the host
* node ip (ip) - the IP of the host. Cloudify uses private IP and assumes that the Cloudify client is in 
the same LAN as the IPs specified in
the configuration file

h1. Using the BYON driver

In order to bootstrap the driver, start the Cloudify shell.
type the bootstrap-cloud command using byon as the cloud provider argument
That's all. 
Cloudify Controller will be installed one of the machines in the pool you designated for management machines and from that point 
you can install any application using the install-application command

h2. Tearing down the BYON installation

In order to shut down the installation, you need to use the teardown-cloud command with byon as cloud provider argument

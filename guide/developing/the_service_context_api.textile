h1. The Service Context API

The Service Context API provides means to access other Application Services or other Service Nodes from within a lifecycle script.


h1. Gaining access to the Service Context API

The ServiceContext API is accessed using the @ServiceContextFactory@:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1700385.js?file=getServiceContext.groovy"></script>


Now, you can access any Application service by name, using the @waitForService@ Method:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1700450.js?file=wait4Cassandra.groovy"></script>

The @current@ service - the service in which the above code would be running - can be accessed using @context.serviceName@.

h1. The Service Methods

The @Service@ object has the following methods:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1700479.js?file=serviceMethods.groovy"></script>

h1. The Service Instance Methods

The @ServiceInstance@ object can be referenced from the @Service@ object using @getInstances()@.

To find out the current instance Id, use @context.getInstanceId()@.

The @ServiceInstance@ object provides the following methods:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1703676.js?file=serviceInstanceMethods.groovy"></script>

h1. Writing and Reading Runtime Attributes

Cloudify enables the user to exchange information between different contexts such as Application, Service and Service Instance, using the Attributes API.

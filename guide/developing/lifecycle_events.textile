p. Describes the Various Life Cycle Events in the Application Lifecycle

h1. Lifecycle Events Overview

Cloudify supports lifecycle events at three levels:
* Application level events - these events are invoked typing commands in the Cloudify Shell
* Service level events - these are supported through the Service Recipe
* Service Instance level events - these are the most important ones. Also supported through the service recipe
* Service and Service instance custom events - are like built in life-cycle events but discussed separately.

h1. Application level events

Application level events are not currently supported by the Application recipe. They are invoked through the shell and are not subject to customization.

There are two events:

Application installation - Installing the application service and starting them by order of dependencies. this process starts when the user types the install-application command on the shell.
 More information bout the application installation can be found under the Application Recipe section.

Application uninstallation - Shutting down the application services and removing the installations and the VMs by order of dependencies. This process starts when the user types the uninstall-application command on the shell.

h1. Service level events

Cluster-level, or service-level, lifecycle events can be customized in the Service Recipe. They are triggered by the ESM. 
These events are useful for doing something just before any service instances have been installed or after the last service instance had been shutdown and the cluster is about to be shutdown. 
They can run on either specific nodes or all nodes.

h1. Service Instance level events

Each service instance has the following lifecycle events that can be customized.

In addition, custom lifecycle events can be added and invoked from the Cloudify shell. For more information see custom lifecycle events.

<h4 class="warn">Known Limitation: In case your start script returns, Cloudify will consider your service instance dead and will attempt re-installing it.
To avoid this undesired behavior, please make your start script sleep forever.
We are working on a fix to this limitation.</h4>

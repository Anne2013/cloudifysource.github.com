A service recipe is comprised of the service descriptor file and its supporting files.

h2. Service Descriptor File

The service descriptor file describes the following information:
* "General":#general: The service name, service type, number of service instances, and the service icon filename
* Compute: Hardware and software requirements
* "Lifecycle events":/guide/developing/lifecycle_events: Maps events to handling scripts or closures and, as such, is the most important part of the service recipe
* Custom commands: Maps custom events to handling scripts that can be invoked as commands using the Cloudify shell
* Plugins: Liveness and Monitoring plugins
* UI layout: The layout for the collected metrics to display in Cloudify's web management console
<h4 class="info">In future releases, Cloudify will also support "*provided services*". These services are not provisioned by Cloudify and are only monitored for availability.</h4>

h3(#general). General Section

The *General* section describes the following attributes:

|_. Attributes |_. Description |
| @name@ | The service name is used to identify the services by the various Cloudify management and monitoring tools. Therefore, the name must be unique across all services that are managed by the same Cloudify controller. |
| @icon@ | This specifies an optional image file to use as an icon for a service in the *Application Map* of the "Cloudify web management console":/guide/monitoring/the_web_management_console. |
| @type@ | The service type is used by the Cloudify web management console to determine the location of the service on the *Application Map*. If you do not specify an @icon@ in this section, the service type also used to determine the icon to display on *Application Map*. The following service types are supported:
<ul><li>WEB_SERVER</li>
<li>APP_SERVER</li>
<li>DATABASE</li>
<li>NOSQL_DB</li>
<li>MESSAGE_BUS</li>
<li>ESB_SERVER</li>
<li>SECURITY_SERVER</li></ul> |
| @numInstances@ | |

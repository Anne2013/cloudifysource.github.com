This topic provides instructions for bootstrapping Cloudify on Windows Azure.

h2. Prerequisites

Before you bootstrap your Windows Azure cloud, make sure that your environment meets all the minimum requirements. For more information, see "Bootstrapping Prerequisites":../bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process#prereqs and "Configuring Azure":../setup/configuring_azure.

h2. Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping on Windows Azure is a process where the Cloudify cloud driver on your machine interacts with the Windows Azure management API to create a new Azure deployment. 

Once your cloud configuration file is ready and contains all the required templates for your future application, you can type *@bootstrap-cloud azure@* at the Cloudify shell prompt to begin bootstrapping you configuration.

The bootstrapping may take up to 10 minutes and when it's done, you can start installing your applications and services using the Cloudify shell prompt (invoke install-service, install-application).

Here's a screenshot of your portal after bootstrapping:

h2(#uninstall). Uninstalling an application

To uninstall an installed application, type: *@uninstall-application@* @<appName>@
at the Cloudify shell prompt.

h2(#tear). Teardown

To shut down the Windows Azure environment, type: *@teardown-cloud@* @<appName>@
at the Cloudify shell prompt.

h4(info). This uninstalls applications and shuts down all the management and service instance machines.

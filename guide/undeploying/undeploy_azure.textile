|_. How to |_. on Azure |
|uninstall a service | Not Available |
|uninstall an application | uninstall-application appName&#42; |
|kill all deployed processes and VMs | azure:teardown-app hosted_service_name |


<br/>

 &#42;*Note:*
# When you invoke *uninstall-application appName* In Azure, it leaves the VMs alive and only kills the deployed services.
# Invoking *install-application appName* In Azure, after invoking *uninstall-application appName* , will be faster since there will be no need to re-create VMs.

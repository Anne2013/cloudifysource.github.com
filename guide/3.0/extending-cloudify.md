# adding custom types
Custom `node` & `relationship` types are needed in one of the following cases:
* User wats to add a new implementation (meaning the new type will use a new plugin)
* User wants to refine an existing type and use it with many type implementations instead of overriding a property in any type implementation (less error prone)

Adding a type is easy! you just need to import a yaml file with a map named `types` where each type is a key-value entry. for example:

{% highlight YAML %}
types:
    my_type:
        derived_from: cloudify.openstack.server
        properties:
            install_agent:false
        # omitted for brevity

{% endhighlight %}

In the above example the `cloudify.openstack.server` is refined in order to not have Cloudify install an agent on each instance.

Note: you can decalre first level properties schema in a type. This will ensure that type implementation will have to include this property
for example, the `cloudify.openstack.server` type declares the `server` property that any instance must have. this property is a map where all instance properties should be decalred by the instance (type implementation)


{% highlight YAML %}
cloudify.openstack.server:
        derived_from: cloudify.types.host
        properties:
            - server
            - management_network_name: ''
            - nova_config: {}
            - neutron_config: {}
        interfaces:
            cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
                - start: nova_plugin.server.start
                - stop: nova_plugin.server.stop
                - delete: nova_plugin.server.delete
            cloudify.interfaces.host:
                - get_state: nova_plugin.server.get_state

{% endhighlight %}

# Adding custom interfaces
You can add custom interfaces with additional hooks in order to create a new automation process. In order to use this interface, you will need a workflow that will invoke the operations and plugin(s) that will implement the operations.
you can add an interface in custom type by adding a new entry to the `interfaces` map

# Developing Plugins

## Overview

Plugins are Cloudify integration with different tools. Whenever you need a new integration, you will need to add a plugin that will implement the lifecycle interface, the relationship.lifecycle interface or other existing or custom interfaces. 

## Project Dependencies & Structure

Plugins are python modules packed as pip packages. You will need to have a `setup.py` file with all the dependencies of your module. 
One dependency that all plugins have is [cloudify-celery-commons library](https://github.com/CloudifySource/cosmo-celery-common/archive/develop.zip) You will need to add it to your project dependencies.

Other dependenies are typically the python API libraries you use. If you have non-python dependencies you should XXXX 

## Coding the Plugin
A plugin has functions that can be invoked by the agent - the same functions you mapped to the interface in your type. These finctions are marked as operations using the `@operation` [python decorator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators). In order to use this decorator and the related `context` object, add to your source the following statement: 
{% highlight python %}
from cloudify.decorators import operation

{% endhighlight %}

Any operation function has the following signature:
{% highlight python %}
@operation
def myfunction(ctx, **kwargs):
# function body

{% endhighlight %}

The `ctx` argument is an instance of `CloudifyContext`. This class exposes several key properties to the developer:

* `node_id` - unique id for the currenrt node
* `node_name` - node name in the blueprint
* `properties` - the node properties as specified in the blueprint YAML files (Read only)
* `runtime_properties` - runtime properties map for retrieving runtime information to the manager and share with other nodes (read only)

* `capabilities` -  dependency nodes runtime properties for example db connection string if the current node has relationship to a db

* `related` - The related node (targer node) in a relationship.
* `logger` - the logger to use (enriches log entires with relevant context and writes to RabbitMQ)
* `blueprint_id` - The blueprint id the plugin invocation belongs to.
* `deployment_id` - The deployment id the plugin invocation belongs to
* `execution_id` -  The workflow execution id the plugin invocation was requested from.
  This is a unique value which identifies a specific workflow execution.
 * `workflow_id` - The workflow id the plugin invocation was requested from.
        For example:
            'install', 'uninstall' etc...
* `task_id` - The plugin's task invocation unique id.
* `task_name` - The full task name of the invoked task.
* `task_target` - The task target (RabbitMQ queue name).
* `plugin` - The plugin name of the invoked task."
* `operation` - The node operation name which is mapped to this task invocation.
        For example: cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.start
        
### Getting properties
Use the `properties` to get access to node:

{% highlight python %}
if 'scripts' in ctx.properties:
    scripts = ctx.properties['scripts']
        
{% endhighlight %}

### Reporting Runtime Properties
Use the context as a map to write runtime properties.
In this example a property of ip is added to a host node.

{% highlight python %}
ctx['ip'] = manager_network_ip
{% endhighlight %}

### Getting access to files
In case your blueprint included files that you need to access during plugin runtime use the following method:

{% highlight python %}
sh = ctx.get_resource(scripts[operation_simple_name])
        
{% endhighlight %}

h1. Overview

h4. Below is a list of new features, improvements, fixed issues, and known issues in Cloudify.
We track all the issues in our public "JIRA":https://cloudifysource.atlassian.net.

<hr/>

"Cloudify 2.3.0 M2":#v230m2  - published on Nov 20, 2012
This version contains the following key improvements:
*  "Multi Tenant Deployment":../developing/service_recipe#mtd - Cloudify now enables users to deploy several services on the same host.
* "BYON on Windows":../setup/configuring_byon -  Users can now install recipes on BYON on Windows machines as well.

<hr/>

"Cloudify 2.3.0 M1":#v230m1  - published on Nov 8, 2012
This version contains the following key improvements:
* "DSL Overrides":../recipe/command_line_reference#install_app - Enables users to override application and service level properties at installation time, without changing the original recipe. 
* "Disable Self Healing":../recipe/command_line_reference#install_app - An option to disable recipes self healing has been added. Now recipes can be activated in a 'debug' mode, in which there are no attempts to recover after failures. It can be achieved by setting the value of the *-disableSelfHealing* argument.
This will allow recipes developers to debug and read log files after failures. 
* "(newwindow)JClouds 1.5.2":http://www.jclouds.org/documentation/releasenotes/1.5/ - Cloudify now supports JClouds 1.5.2 GA for the default cloud driver.

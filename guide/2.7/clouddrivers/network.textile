Cloudify will provide the following with 2.7 (Dec 2013)
Network Abstraction in recipe and in Cloud driver
Implementation for OpenStack Neutron
Scope of support:
Assign multiple virtual networks to VMs using multiple vNIC  - networks can be predefined or provisioned by Cloudify
Security Group definitions in recipe: Create security groups and bind VMs to these groups
Network templates: create networks for applications and services using templates in the Cloud Driver configuration
Create, terminate bind and unbind floating IPs using API from the recipe


Bootstrapping Cloudify with Management network for managers and agent - Bootstrap process binds to
 management network and subnet predefined with a router to link the management subnet to the external network (REST & GUI endpoints).
Installing application with networks, security groups and floating Ips.  Cloud Driver binds to:
application networks and subnets predefined
 security groups which are predefined
If floating IP API is to be used - user must have the network bind to an external network via router


Bootstrapping Cloudify with Management network for managers and agent - Bootstrap process creates
management network and subnet.
A router to link the management subnet to the external network (REST & GUI endpoints).
Installing application with networks, security groups and floating Ips.  Cloud Driver creates:
application networks and subnets on based on user's configuration.
Security groups as defined in the recipes
 ports are created when VMs are attached to a subnet.

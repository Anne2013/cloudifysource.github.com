We are happy to announce a new Cloudify service pack (2.1.1) as General Availability.
This service pack provides many stability improvements thanks to customers and community users reporting issues and asking questions about their use cases.

In addition, we are releasing the enhanced "process locator":/guide/developing/lifecycle_events#locator feature allowing for multi-process recipes. 
Using the process locator, you can give Cloudify a list of process IDs to monitor for availability and use as a trigger for service recovery.

This opens the door for colocation of several tiers in the same virtual machine.

Here's an example of how to monitor two different applications with the process locator.
In this example, the monitored applications are Apache Web Server and Tomcat Servlet Engine:

In one of our next blog posts, we'll show you how to use "(newwindow)PTQL":http://support.hyperic.com/display/SIGAR/PTQL in cloudify recipes to monitor the basic KPIs (cpu,memory,etc) for each of these processes.

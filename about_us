Traditional PaaS limits your cloud portability, and choice of application stack, simply put.

GigaSpaces Cloudify enables you to on-board and scale any app, on any cloud, with no code changes, while maintaining full visibility and control.

How is this done?
Cloudify is external to your application stack, meaning no code change required
Cloudify is not just for deployment; it manages and monitors your application
Cloudify helps your IT organization become automated, elastic, and agile

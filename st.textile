<p><b>Have you been looking to take advantage of the promise of the cloud only to discover that migrating your app to the cloud is a complex mess?</b></p>
h2. No more! We invite you to Take the Cloudify Challenge! 

<p>Cloudify enables you to take any app – no matter what its stack to the cloud of your choice – with ZERO code changes. Sound too good to be true? Then by all means, come out and see it in action. Join us at OpenStack Israel, and enter your application in the Cloudify challenge. One application will be selected at random by a panel of judges, combined with your votes, to be demoed live at the event. 

<p><b>If we lose – you win! We’ll give you a prize! If we win – you win! So what do you have to lose?</b></p>

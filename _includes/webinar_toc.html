Topic: Deploying Your Big Data App on OpenStack

The massive computing and storage resources that are needed to support big data applications make cloud environments an ideal fit.

In this session, you'll learn how to build your big data "database on-demand" using MongoDB, Cassandra, Solr, MySQL, or any other big data solution, as well as manage your big data application using a new open source framework called “Cloudify.”

All this, on top of the OpenStack cloud.

  <span class="title">How to Manage your Sharded MongoDB Setup on Any Cloud</span>
  <p>MongoDB supports an automated sharding architecture, enabling horizontal scaling across multiple nodes. 

With MongoDB you can convert to a sharded cluster, automatically managing failover and balancing of nodes, with few or no changes to the original application code. 

Managing a sharded mongo setup is no trivial task. 

In this webinar, Uri Cohen, VP Product Management will teach you how to easily set it up, monitor and scale it on any cloud environment using Cloudify.

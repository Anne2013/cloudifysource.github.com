  <span class="title">Extending Chef to Manage the Entire Application Lifecycle</span>
  <p>Marrying DevOps and PaaS: Tools like Chef and Puppet have gained a lot of momentum in the last year or so. 

But the concept of DevOps and recipes can go well beyond setup, to actually accelerate the entire lifecycle of your applications, from setup, to monitoring, through maintaining high availability, and auto-scaling when required. In this session we'll see how to use Chef and Cloudify together to create a complete and powerful application level orchestration on any cloud, using Cloudify and Chef. 

More specifically, we'll learn how to automatically provision nodes on the cloud of your choice, based the requirements of your application, auto install Chef client on the provisioned VMs and run the proper Chef roles and recipe on them, and then monitor and auto scale the installed application.</p>

  <span class="title">How to Manage your Sharded MongoDB Setup on Any Cloud</span>
  <p>MongoDB supports an automated sharding architecture, enabling horizontal scaling across multiple nodes. 

With MongoDB you can convert to a sharded cluster, automatically managing failover and balancing of nodes, with few or no changes to the original application code. 

Managing a sharded mongo setup is no trivial task. 

In this webinar, Uri Cohen, VP Product Management will teach you how to easily set it up, monitor and scale it on any cloud environment using Cloudify.

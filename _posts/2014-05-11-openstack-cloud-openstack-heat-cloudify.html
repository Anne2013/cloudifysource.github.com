<p>The OpenStack Summit is about to begin and Team Cloudify has landed in Atlanta! Once again we are looking forward to an action packed week with our fellow stackers and are ready to make some noise around some juicy updates.</p>

<p>The latest and greatest version of Cloudify, version 3.0, is set to launch with it's early edition drop. Get ready for more nodes, any workflow and deeper OpenStack integration with our TOSCA-based cloud orchestration platform.</p>

<p>We've been working closely with our partners at HP Cloud to provide pre-integration of this new release for HP Cloud with support for the most advanced features, namely Neutron and others.</p>

<p>Don't miss our two sessions with HP on Monday - one with our customers at HP Print discussing use of OpenStack in the Real World, and another panel session with fellow HP partners discussing developments in their OpenStack technology.</p>

<p>Monday night, stop by the GigaSpaces table E-19 during the booth crawl for some Israeli snacks, then head over to the Nebula booth C-3 for a free bourbon tasting sponsored by GigaSpaces and Nebula.</p>

<p>Be sure to drop off your contact details with Team Cloudify to enter to win this year's MONSTER giveaway - a bi-plane ride around Atlanta!</p>

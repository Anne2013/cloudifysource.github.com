                                    <p>Deployment Automation on OpenStack with TOSCA and Cloudify</p>
<p>TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) is an emerging standard for modeling complete application stacks and automating their deployment and management. It’s been discussed in the context of OpenStack for quite some time, mostly around Heat. In this session we’ll discuss what TOSCA is all about, why it makes sense in the context of OpenStack, and how we can take it farther up the stack to handle complete applications, both during and after deployment, on top of OpenStack.

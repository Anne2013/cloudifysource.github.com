                                   <b class="title">Community Event: A Groovy Kind of Java - San Francisco Java User Group</b>
                                    <p>Hot on the heals of Hans Dockters' talk on Gradle, Uri Cohen, from GigaSpaces, offered to tell us about additional ways Java developers can leverage Groovy.

Today's application stack is built out many popular OSS frameworks such as Cassandra, MongoDB, Scala, Play, Memcache, RabitMQ alongside the more traditional JEE stack which includes app servers such as Tomcat and JBoss. In this environment the same practices that we used to have in JEE centric world for managing and deploying our app are not relevant anymore. In this session we'll introduce a new open source frameworks based on Groovy for packaging your application, automating the scaling, failover, and more.

As always, the venue, food, drinks, and giveaways will be provided by our sponsors.

Some of you may remember Nati Shalom's talk about Building Realtime Analytics System with Cassandra and GigaSpaces from last year.</p>

                                    <p>Don't miss out on GigaSpaces' CTO, Nati Shalom, who will be presenting on "How to Build a Cloud Marketplace - The Easy Way".  <b>Session Abstract:</b> Many cloud providers, both public and private, increasingly face the challenge of offering a growing number of products through their cloud.

It's clear that the DIY model doesn't scale, and often times takes years to accomplish. This is a clear case where a markeplace approach would be a much better fit.

However, there are a number of technical and business challenges involved with building a cloud marketplace for IT products. For example, in order for a cloud marketplace to offer any value, it needs to be able to offer hundreds or potentially even thousands of products, yet at the same time, there's the demand of being able to bring a large number of users into the marketplace - while both of these components need to happen virtually simultaneously - which is no easy feat. In this session, we'll go through several real-life experiences in building cloud marketplaces, and demonstrate how this challenges can be met easily.</p>

                                   <b class="title">Community Event: The DevOps Showdown: Ruby vs. Groovy</b>
                                    <p>Ruby has been the most popular DevOps language to date, providing excellent built-in features for DevOps, as well as being used in leading DevOps tools such as Chef, Puppet, Noah and others. However, for developers focused on the JVM, mastering Ruby and Ruby-based tools is not always a trivial option.

The release of Groovy 2.0, the emergence of new Groovy based DevOps tools such Gradle, Cloudify and Glu, and also a few built-in features in Groovy such as AntBuilder and Grapes, make Groovy a good candidate to serve as a DevOps foundation for JVM-oriented developers.

In this meetup, we'll run a head-to-head showdown between Ruby and Groovy. We'll have experts from both camps debate various DevOps related aspects of both languages such as ease of use, portability, file system and other admin operations support, external process management, security, speed, echo system, etc.

We welcome your involvement, so if you feel you're up to the challenge and want to take part in the showdown, please let us know!</p>

                                    <p>Cloudify's Uri Cohen will speak about "Building your own OpsWorks with Chef, Cloudify and OpenStack" at the 3rd OpenStack Israel. AWS OpsWorks is a DevOps solution for managing applications of any scale or complexity on the AWS cloud. With OpsWorks you can manage your complete application lifecycle, including resource provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, software updates, monitoring, etc. However, OpsWorks is only applicable to AWS. What if you could create and manage a similar service on top of OpenStack? 

Cloudify takes a similar approach to OpsWorks by allowing users to compose application stacks by building on top of Chef recipes or Puppet manifests and supporting application level concerns such as orchestration, multi-tier dependency management, monitoring and auto-scaling recipes. In this session we'll introduce Cloudify and how it leverages Chef and Puppet as a key enabler for an OpsWorks-like framework on top of OpenStack.</p>

                                   <b class="title">Community Event: The DevOps Showdown: Ruby vs. Groovy</b>
                                    <p>Ruby has been the most popular DevOps language to date, providing excellent built-in features for DevOps, as well as being used in leading DevOps tools such as Chef, Puppet, Noah and others. However, for developers focused on the JVM, mastering Ruby and Ruby-based tools is not always a trivial option.

The release of Groovy 2.0, the emergence of new Groovy based DevOps tools such Gradle, Cloudify and Glu, and also a few built-in features in Groovy such as AntBuilder and Grapes, make Groovy a good candidate to serve as a DevOps foundation for JVM-oriented developers.

In this meetup, we'll run a head-to-head showdown between Ruby and Groovy. We'll have experts from both camps debate various DevOps related aspects of both languages such as ease of use, portability, file system and other admin operations support, external process management, security, speed, echo system, etc.

We welcome your involvement, so if you feel you're up to the challenge and want to take part in the showdown, please let us know!</p>

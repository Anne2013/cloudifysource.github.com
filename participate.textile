                                    <p>Join Nati Shalom for the first in a series of OpenStack online meetups, who will be discussing "Getting your Open Source Framework on OpenStack is Now Simpler than on Amazon, GAE." The number of open source frameworks is continuously growing at an enormous pace, with over a million unique open source projects available today. However, itâ€™s often times a tedious undertaking exploring, and integrating these new open source projects.  This becomes especially complex when looking to do so with OpenStack which is conceived as being fairly involved project in and of itself.

In this discussion we will present how we can apply the same principles from the open source world, such as versioning and collaboration, as well as the experience from sharing media content from sites like YouTube to build a generic service for deploying and sharing open source projects on HP OpenStack. </p>

                                    <p>Ruby has been the most popular DevOps language to date, providing excellent built-in features for DevOps, as well as being used in leading DevOps tools such as Chef, Puppet, Noah and others. However, for developers focused on the JVM, mastering Ruby and Ruby-based tools is not always a trivial option.

The release of Groovy 2.0, the emergence of new Groovy based DevOps tools such Gradle, Cloudify and Glu, and also a few built-in features in Groovy such as AntBuilder and Grapes, make Groovy a good candidate to serve as a DevOps foundation for JVM-oriented developers.

In this meetup, we'll run a head-to-head showdown between Ruby and Groovy. We'll have experts from both camps debate various DevOps related aspects of both languages such as ease of use, portability, file system and other admin operations support, external process management, security, speed, echo system, etc.

We welcome your involvement, so if you feel you're up to the challenge and want to take part in the showdown, please let us know!</p>

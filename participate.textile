                                    <p>When thinking about automation and orchestration most people have tools like CloudFormation, Chef or Puppet in mind. These tools do a great job at allocating infrastructure resources and configuring them. But in reality, when deploying and managing complete application stacks, there’s much more to it. You need things to be done in a certain order; there are dependencies to consider and information to share between your application tiers, and then there’s everything related to post deployment - recovering from failures, scaling and continuously deploying your code, to name some. In this session we’ll discuss what it takes to orchestrate and automate your applications through the entire lifecycle, and without losing control.</p>

                                   <b class="title">Community Event: CloudStack Collaboration Conference North America</b>
                                    <p>The Cloudify team will be presenting three stellar sessions at the upcoming CloudStack Collab Conference North America - April 9-11, 2014.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://sched.co/1hETwSO" target="_blank">It's the App, Stupid!</a>, Uri Cohen</b></p>
<p>Managing and deploying applications on CloudStack (or any other cloud for that matter) can be a daunting task. Resource provisioning, software installation and configuration, failure detection and handling, scaling and continuous delivery are just some of the processes that should be performed (read: automated) in order to do it properly. There are multiple tool chains that tackle some of these processes, each with its own focus and level of control. These can range from pure CM tools such as Chef or Puppet, which focus on repeatable and consistent configuration of servers, all the way to full blown PaaS environments that focus on developer productivity and hide many of the complexities of the underlying infrastructure. 
In this session Uri will present the problem domain of application deployment and management on the cloud, the benefits and shortcomings of common approaches to it.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://sched.co/1hEUhLv" target="_blank">Making TOSCA Simple on CloudStack</a>, Yaron Parasol</b></p>
<p>TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) is an emerging standard for modeling complete application stacks and automating their deployment and management. In this session we’ll discuss what TOSCA is all about, why it makes sense in the context of CloudStack, and how we can take it farther up the stack to handle complete applications, both during and after deployment, on top of CloudStack.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://sched.co/1hESje8" target="_blank">An App-Centric Approach to DevOps</a>, Nati Shalom</b></p>
<p>A case study on how one of the largest betting sites in the world brought agility and better ROI to their online gaming initiatives, from the development cycle and initial concept to revenue generation, by phasing out old cultural processes, combined with a new tooling to bring about an app-centric DevOps revolution within the organization, all this on top of Cloudstack.
<br/>
A large UK enterprise found themselves struggling with known DevOps pain points from slow and laborious provisioning of infrastructure, lack of consistency between and within environments, through inconsistent tooling with no standardization - that often times affected the rollout of releases and updates. This session will present this organization's journey toward application-centric DevOps, and how they achieved consistency and continuous delivery by deploying their apps to Cloudstack, using Chef and Cloudify.</p>

                                    <p>The massive computing and storage resources that are needed to support big data applications make cloud environments an ideal fit. Now more than ever, there is a growing number of choices of cloud infrastructure providers, from Amazon AWS, OpenStack offered by the likes of HP, Rackspace and soon even Dell, VMware vCloud as well as private cloud offerings based on OpenStack, CloudStack, vCloud, and more. There is also a new class of bare-metal clouds from SoftLayer and PistonCloud that provide high performance resources designed for I/O and CPU intensive applications that don’t run as well on a virtualized resources. The recent announcements by Google &  Microsoft about their new infrastructure as a service offerings, add additional significant players to this growing marketplace.</p>
<p>Given the diverse options, and the dynamic environments involved, it becomes ever more important to maintain the flexibility to choose the right cloud for the job.  In this session, you'll learn how to deploy and manage a Cassandra cluster on any Cloud, as well as manage the rest of your big data application stack using a new open source framework called “Cloudify.” (Visit cloudifysource.org)
As part of the session, we will demonstrate a live deployment of a Cassandra cluster on multiple clouds.</p>

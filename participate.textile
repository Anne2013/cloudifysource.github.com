                                    <p>Join Nati Shalom for the first in a series of OpenStack online meetups, who will be discussing "Getting your Open Source Framework on OpenStack is Now Simpler than on Amazon, GAE." The number of open source frameworks is continuously growing at an enormous pace, with over a million unique open source projects available today. However, itâ€™s often times a tedious undertaking exploring, and integrating these new open source projects.  This becomes especially complex when looking to do so with OpenStack which is conceived as being fairly involved project in and of itself.

In this discussion we will present how we can apply the same principles from the open source world, such as versioning and collaboration, as well as the experience from sharing media content from sites like YouTube to build a generic service for deploying and sharing open source projects on HP OpenStack. </p>
